# DOSMA: Deep Open-Source Medical Image Analysis
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

DOSMA is an AI-powered Python library for medical image analysis. This includes, but is not limited to:
- image processing (denoising, super-resolution, registration, segmentation, etc.)
- quantitative fitting and image analysis
- anatomical visualization and analysis (patellar tilt, femoral cartilage thickness, etc.)

We hope that this open-source pipeline will be useful for quick anatomy/pathology analysis and will serve as a hub for adding support for analyzing different anatomies and scan sequences.
